<p>Hello! This HTML project is about saving tigers. Today, there are only 1411 tigers in India and less than 3500 in the wild. This is why they are in the top 10 endangered species.</p>

<h2>Why Save Tigers?</h2>
1. If tigers become extinct in the areas where tigers are the main predators, the population of the preys will increase and hence the vegetation of the area will decrease. And if the vegetation decreases, the preys will also start dying. So the area will lose all its animals and plants.
<br>
2. Tigers are the national animal of India! It wouldn't be nice to have an extinct national animal. And if the tiger becomes extinct, the future generations will only see tigers in pictures...
<br>
3. It is a living being and like you and me and it also feels pain.

<h2>Why Are Tigers Disappearing?</h2>
1. Due to loss of habitat. Because of global warming leading to climate change and deforestation, tigers are losing their natural habitat.
<br>
2. The major reason for this is poaching. Though it is illegal now, hunters continue to kill tigers for their body parts (especially hide for leather) or for fun.
